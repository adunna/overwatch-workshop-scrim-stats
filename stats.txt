INFRA:

- python webapp base (maybe flask?)
-- something host on github, so javascript would be better i think

OTHER TOOL IDEAS:

- share replay codes amongst team(s)? can keep track of patches and add notes to them, make them available to teams

WORKSHOP CHANGES:

- log map & game mode at beginning in first row
- log general map things over time separately from each player's row, so we don't have the same variables repeated

directly available player stats:

- all damage dealt
- barrier damage dealt
- damage blocked
- damage taken
- deaths
- elims
- final blows
- enviro deaths
- enviro kills
- hero damage dealt
- healing dealt
- objective kills
- solo kills
- ultimates earned
- ultimates used
(hero section)
- healing received
(other section)
- ult charge over time
- player closest to reticle

map stats:

- payload progress percentage / point capture percentage /  (make sure to set dependent on map)

derived player stats:

- stuff per 10
- time to ult
-- time ult held
- time staggered (death after fight)
- feed deaths (death before fight)
- ult efficiency (ults earned / ults used)
- poke damage taken (damage before fight)

derived fight stats:

- first ult
- first deaths
- focus fire during fight
-- use player closest to reticle
- grouped-ness
- rotation time

other ideas:

- meta-dependent stats, ex:
-- double shield
--- peeking without shield?
